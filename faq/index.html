We bring the 'dealership' to you, cutting out the tow fee and typically saving you 30-50% on the key itself."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is an EEPROM car key service?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Some European vehicles (BMW, VW, Audi) require 'EEPROM' programming, where we safely read the data directly from the car's computer chip rather than the OBD port. We are among the few locksmiths in NJ certified for this advanced level of automotive security."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you replace a car key if I don't have the original code?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. We can pull your key code directly from the vehicle's VIN or by de-coding the physical wafers inside your door lock. You do not need the original dealer code for us to help you."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will a new key automatically disable my lost ones?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In most modern 'Proximity' or 'Push-to-Start' systems, we can perform a 'Key Deletion' during the programming process. This wipes the lost key from the car's memory, ensuring that even if someone finds it, they cannot start your vehicle."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between 'Fail-Safe' and 'Fail-Secure' locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is a critical distinction for fire safety. A 'Fail-Safe' lock (like a Magnetic Lock) releases when power is lost, allowing for immediate exit. A 'Fail-Secure' lock (like an Electric Strike) remains locked from the outside when power is lost but allows a mechanical handle to open the door from the inside. We ensure your system is configured to meet NJ State Fire Codes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can we use our iPhones or Apple Watches to unlock the office doors?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Modern systems utilize 'Mobile Credentials' via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Near Field Communication (NFC). Users can simply tap their phone or even just approach the door with their phone in their pocket to gain access. This eliminates the cost and hassle of physical plastic cards."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I manage access for three different NJ locations from one portal?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. Our Cloud-Based platforms (like Brivo or Openpath) are designed for multi-site management. You can manage a warehouse in Secaucus, a retail store in North Bergen, and an office in Jersey City all from a single dashboard, with unified user profiles across all locations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens if our internet goes out? Will the doors stop working?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Professional access control 'Controllers' have internal memory that stores a copy of the authorized database. If the cloud connection is lost, the doors will continue to operate normally for all existing users. The system will then 'sync' the audit logs to the cloud once the connection is restored."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does biometrics (fingerprint/face) work with employee privacy laws?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Professional biometric readers do not store an 'image' of the finger or face. Instead, they convert the biological measurements into an encrypted mathematical 'template.' This template cannot be used to reconstruct a fingerprint, protecting your employees' privacy while providing unbreakable security."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between 'Cloning' and 'Programming' a key?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Cloning makes an exact digital 'twin' of your existing key. The car thinks the clone IS the original. Programming involves adding a brand-new ID to a specific slot in your vehicle's computer. Cloning is the faster and safer method for many older cars, while Programming is required for most modern smart-fob systems. We choose the optimal method based on your car's specific security architecture."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a hardware store duplicate my car key?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Standard hardware stores can only duplicate basic metal keys. They lack the expensive diagnostic computers required to communicate with a car's immobilizer. Even 'Automated Kiosks' often fail to correctly program the chip or handle laser-cut keys. As automotive specialists, we guarantee a 100% functional key with both mechanical and electronic integrity."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it better to have two different fobs or two 'Clones' of the same fob?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For modern vehicles, having two separate programmed IDs is superior. If one key is lost and later found, we can disable only the lost ID. If you have two clones and lose one, we have to wipe and reset the entire system. We recommend native programming for all vehicles newer than 2015."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does a car key duplication take on-site?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A standard transponder key takes about 15-20 minutes. A high-security smart fob for a luxury vehicle may take 30-40 minutes as the car's computer often requires a 'timed security delay' before allowing us to enter the programming interface."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My original key is worn and sticking. Will a duplicate also stick?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Not if we do it. Instead of tracing your worn key (which would just replicate the damage), we use our 'Optical Decoder' to determine the original factory cuts (the 'bitting'). We then cut a fresh key to the original factory specifications, which often works better than your current worn-out original."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will unlocking my car with professional tools damage the air bags?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely not. Modern vehicles have Side Impact Airbags (SABs) located in the door pillars or seats. Amateur 'slim-jim' methods can trip these sensors or snag wiring. Our NDE (Non-Destructive Entry) methods use the lock cylinder or internal handle, completely bypassing the airbag deployment zones."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why can't I just use a wire hanger like in the movies?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Modern cars (post-1995) have internal shielding around the lock rods specifically to prevent 'coat hanger' entry. Attempting this will likely pull the weather stripping off or, worse, disconnect the lock linkage, turning a simple lockout into an expensive mechanical repair."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a Lishi tool and why is it better?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Lishi tool is a precision instrument that we insert into your lock cylinder. It allows us to 'decode' and 'pick' each individual wafer in the lock simultaneously. It is the gold standard for damage-free entry because it never touches your car's body or window seals."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"I locked my keys in the trunk, and my car has no trunk button. Can you help?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Many luxury cars disable the interior trunk release when the alarm is active. We use a method called 'Lock Decoding' to read the bitting of the door lock and then use a specialized machine to cut a temporary 'service key' that opens your trunk mechanically."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you service lockouts in parking garages or major NJ malls?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. We frequently respond to the American Dream Mall, Jersey Gardens, and Willowbrook Mall. Our compact mobile units can enter most low-clearance parking garages to assist you at your vehicle's location."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How can you make a key if I don't have the original?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is the difference between a high-tech automotive locksmith and a hardware store booth. We use a 'Lishi' tool or a 'Scope' to decode the internal wafers of your door lock. This gives us the 'Bitting Code.' We then cross-reference your VIN with the manufacturer's database to verify the correct electronic transponder profile before cutting and programming a fresh key from scratch."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why does the dealership say it takes 3 days to get a key?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Dealerships often do not have on-site key cutters or EEPROM programmers. They typically order pre-cut keys from a central warehouse based on your VIN. As a mobile automotive specialist, we carry blank 'Smart Keys' for almost every major make (Honda, Toyota, BMW, Ford, etc.) and perform the cutting and programming right next to your car."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a Transponder Chip, and why is it necessary?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Since the late 1990s, cars have an 'Immobilizer System.' The key head contains a tiny passive RFID chip. When you turn the ignition, the car's computer (ECU) sends a pulse. The chip must respond with a matched encrypted code. If it doesn't, the fuel pump is disabled. We program this specific handshake on-site."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you make keys for high-end European brands like BMW or Mercedes?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Unlike many locksmiths, we specialize in European 'CAS' and 'EIS' systems. These require advanced bench-programming (EEPROM) where we read the data directly from the car's security module. This allows us to provide keys for BMW, Mercedes, Audi, and VW at a portion of the dealer's cost."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will my new key also work my remote buttons (Lock/Unlock)?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. When we program a 'Remote Head' or 'Smart Fob,' we ensure all functions are synchronized—including proximity entry, push-to-start, trunk release, and panic buttons."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is an SFIC (Small Format Interchangeable Core) system?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"SFIC is a standard in commercial locksmithing where the lock cylinder (the 'core') can be removed using a special 'control key' without taking the entire lock off the door. This allows a facility manager to rekey a door in 3 seconds. We specialize in Best, Falcon, and Arrow SFIC profiles for major NJ office complexes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why can't I use residential locks on my business doors?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Beyond the obvious security vulnerability, residential locks are not fire-rated for commercial use and do not meet ADA (Americans with Disabilities) requirements for 'unassisted egress.' Furthermore, a residential lock will typically fail within months if subjected to the high-frequency use of a retail storefront."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are your commercial locks fire-rated?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. For stairwell doors and corridor entry points, we exclusively install UL-Listed, 3-hour fire-rated hardware. We ensure that the lock and the strike plate do not compromise the 'Listing' of your fire-rated door assembly, keeping you in compliance with NJ State Fire Marshall requirements."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you replace locks on aluminum storefront glass doors?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Storefront doors use a specific 'narrow-stile' mortise lock (typically Adams Rite). These require specialized technical adjustment of the drive-cam and pivoting bolt. We carry all necessary configurations, including electrified versions for remote buzzing-in."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do you handle lock replacement for high-turnover businesses?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For retail and hospitality, we recommend either SFIC systems or cloud-managed electronic locks. These allow you to invalidate previous employee access immediately, reducing the long-term cost of locksmith visits."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between 'Panic Hardware' and 'Fire Exit Hardware'?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is a critical distinction in NJ building codes. 'Panic Hardware' features a dogging mechanism (allowing the bar to be locked in the retracted position). This cannot be used on fire-rated doors. 'Fire Exit Hardware' is UL-Listed for fire doors and must be 'positive latching' at all times to prevent the door from bowing and allowing the spread of smoke during a fire."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are 'Vertical Rod' exit devices necessary for all double doors?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If your double doors do not have a center post (mullion), then at least one door (usually both) must have vertical rods to secure the door at the top and bottom. We specialize in both surface-mounted and concealed vertical rods (CVR), ensuring that your double doors remain secure against forced entry while providing easy egress."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can we install a panic bar that alerts us when someone uses the back door?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we frequently install 'Alarmed Exit Devices' (like the Detex Advantex series). These units feature a 100dB+ siren that triggers if the bar is pushed. This is the industry standard for retail stockrooms and back-of-house areas, providing fire-legal egress while preventing internal and external theft."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Our panic bar is 'dragging' on the floor. Can it be repaired?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Usually, this is a timing or alignment issue with the vertical rods or a sagging hinge. We are experts in 'Timing' commercial hardware. We'll adjust the top and bottom latches to ensure they retract fully when the bar is pushed, preventing floor drag and ensuring a smooth, compliant operation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is 'Delayed Egress' hardware?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Delayed egress devices (NFPA 101 compliant) sound an alarm and delay the door from opening for 15 seconds after someone pushes the bar. This is used in healthcare and retail to prevent 'Dash and Grab' theft or wandering patients, while still unlocking automatically if the fire alarm is triggered."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does a master key system improve business security?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A master key system reduces 'key creep.' Instead of employees carrying 10 keys, they carry 1 that only opens their authorized zones. By using restricted keyways, we also prevent unauthorized key duplication at hardware stores, ensuring you have 100% control over who has access."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the ADA requirements for commercial door hardware in NJ?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all commercial door hardware must be operable with one hand and not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. This typically means replacing knob locks with lever-style handles. We ensure all your exterior and interior doors meet these federal standards."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I manage my business access control from my smartphone?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. We specialize in cloud-based access control systems. You can lock/unlock doors, add or delete employee credentials, and view entry logs in real-time from anywhere in the world using your mobile device."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a 'Panic Bar' and is it required for my storefront?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A panic bar (or rim exit device) allows for immediate egress during an emergency. In NJ, if your building has a certain occupancy load or is a specific type of business (like a restaurant or school), fire codes mandate these devices. We provide code-compliant installation and testing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you offer 'After-Hours' service for commercial emergencies?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. We understand that a broken storefront lock or a failed security gate at 10 PM is a liability. We provide 24/7 priority emergency response for our commercial clients throughout Northern New Jersey."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take for an emergency locksmith to arrive?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In Northern NJ, particularly Hudson and Bergen Counties, our average arrival time is promptly. We use a real-time GPS dispatch system to send the technician physically closest to your location."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will unlocking my car damage the power locks or windows?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Unlike amateur 'slim-jim' methods that can pull wires or damage weather-stripping, we use precision air-wedges and long-reach tools that never touch your internal door mechanics."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a locksmith open a high-security lock like Mul-T-Lock or Medeco?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most emergency locksmiths cannot. However, Royal Locksmith technicians carry specialized picking tools for high-security cylinders. While these take longer than standard locks, we can often bypass them without drilling."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What if my key is broken inside the lock?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Don't try to pull it out yourself—you'll likely push it deeper. We use surgical-grade extraction tools to remove the broken blade without replacing the entire cylinder."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you service lockouts during blizzards or holidays?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Our mobile fleet is equipped for all weather conditions. We remain fully operational 365 days a year, including holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why is my key fob suddenly not being recognized by my car?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is often due to a 'Rolling Code' desynchronization. For security, fobs and cars change their 'code' every time a button is pressed. If the fob is pressed many times away from the car, or if the car's battery died, they may lose their 'sync.' We use an OBD-II interface to 're-introduce' the security seed to both the fob and the Body Control Module (BCM)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you program a key fob I bought on eBay or Amazon?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We can certainly try, but with a warning: many online fobs are 'Locked' (previously paired with another car) or use low-quality frequencies that the car's computer will reject. We carry a massive inventory of 'Virgin' fobs that are guaranteed to program successfully the first time."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I do if my smart key dies and I'm locked out?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Every smart key fob has a hidden mechanical 'Emergency Blade' inside. There is also a hidden keyhole on your car door (sometimes behind a plastic cap). Once inside, most cars have a 'Backup Slot' or you simply hold the fob directly against the Start button to allow a passive transponder handshake to start the engine. We can show you this process during your service."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you program a second fob so my spouse and I each have one?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. In fact, we recommend it. Many modern cars require at least two programmed keys in the memory to perform certain diagnostic resets or for insurance 'All Keys Lost' protection. We can program as many as your car's computer allows (usually up to 8)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much cheaper is a locksmith than the dealership for fob programming?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Typically, we are 30-50% more affordable. More importantly, we save you the 'Dealership Tax' of towing your car and waiting days for a service appointment. We come to you and complete the job in 20-30 minutes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between a 'Master Key' and a 'Grand Master Key'?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In a hierarchical system, a 'Master Key' typically opens a specific department or section (e.g., all 2nd-floor offices). A 'Grand Master Key' is one level higher, opening every lock in the entire facility across all departments. We can even add a 'Great Grand Master' for multi-building campuses."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How safe is a master key system? Can it be easily picked?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A master-keyed lock technically has more shear lines (potential opening points) than a single-keyed lock. However, when designed by a professional, this does not significantly reduce picking resistance. For maximum security, we recommend master-keying high-security cylinders like Medeco or Mul-T-Lock, which are virtually pick-proof regardless of the master pinning."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you implement a master key system on my existing locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If your locks are of the same brand or share a compatible keyway (like Schlage C), we can typically re-pin them into a master system. If your building has a mix of incompatible brands, we may recommend replacing the cylinders with a unified SFIC or high-security system to achieve a single-key solution."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is 'Cross-Keying' and why is it dangerous?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Cross-keying occurs when a lock is pinned to respond to key codes from different branches of the hierarchy that shouldn't match. This 'Ghosting' can happen in amateur systems, where a key intended for Room A accidentally opens Room B. Our precision software-designed charts eliminate these mathematical errors."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do restricted keyways protect my business?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Standard keys can be copied at any automated kiosk or hardware store. Restricted keyways use patent-protected blanks that are only distributed to authorized locksmiths. We hold the registration for your specific key profile, ensuring that only people with your signed authorization can ever obtain a duplicate."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why is my car key suddenly not turning in the ignition?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is usually caused by 'wafer collapse' or metal fatigue. High-security keys (like Honda and Ford) use tiny brass wafers. Over 5-10 years, these wafers wear down or bend, preventing the cylinder from reaching the 'shear line.' If you have to jiggle your key, the ignition is failing. We can rebuild the cylinder with fresh, reinforced wafers on-site."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"If you replace my ignition, will I need a new set of keys?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Unlike a dealership that will simply give you a new ignition with a new key code (meaning your old keys won't open your doors), we perform 'Ignition Re-Pinning.' We disassemble the new cylinder and match its internal configuration to your original key profile. This maintains a 'One Key' system for your vehicle."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a stuck key in the ignition drain my battery?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. If the key is stuck in the 'ACC' (Accessory) or 'ON' position, your car's electrical systems remain active. If we cannot reach you immediately, we recommend disconnecting the negative battery terminal. We can then extract the key and repair the locking mechanism without any further electrical damage."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between the ignition 'Cylinder' and the ignition 'Switch'?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The **Cylinder** is the mechanical part where you insert the key. The **Switch** is the electrical component behind it that sends power to the starter. If your key turns but the car doesn't CRANK, it's usually the switch. If the key won't even rotate, it's the cylinder. We carry replacement parts for both."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My steering wheel is locked and the key won't turn. Is my ignition broken?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Not necessarily. This is often 'Steering Lock Binding.' If you parked with your wheels turned, the steering column is putting pressure on the ignition bolt. Try turning the steering wheel firmly to the left and right while simultaneously attempting to turn the key. If it still won't budge, the internal locking pin may be seized, requiring our intervention."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"If I rekey my lock, does the old key still work?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. The rekeying process involves removing the internal pins and replacing them with a new set of varying heights. Once the cylinder is reassembled with the new pins, the old key will no longer align with the shear line, making it physically impossible for the old key to rotate the lock."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is rekeying as secure as getting new locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, from an access control perspective. If your existing locks are physically robust (Grade 1 or 2), rekeying is perfectly secure. However, if your locks are old, rusted, or of low quality, replacing them with a higher-grade model would be the better security choice."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you rekey different brands of locks to the same key?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is a common question. You can only 'Key Alike' locks that share the same 'Keyway' (the shape of the key hole). For example, you can rekey a Schlage deadbolt and an Emtek handleset to the same key because they both use the 'SC1' keyway. You cannot rekey a Kwikset to a Schlage key without replacing the entire cylinder."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take for a locksmith to rekey a whole house?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A standard 3-bedroom home with 5 or 6 locks typically takes 45 to 90 minutes. This includes removing the cylinders, re-pinning them, cutting the new keys, and testing the operation of every door."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a 'Master Key' system for a house?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A master key system allows one 'Grand Master' key to open every door, while other keys (like one for a tenant or a cleaning service) only open specific doors. We can design these multi-tier access systems for your home on the spot."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why is my key suddenly difficult to turn in the lock?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is usually caused by one of three things: internal debris/grit, an unlubricated cylinder whereby the pins are dragging, or most commonly, a slight misalignment between the door and the frame. As the seasons change in NJ, wood doors expand and contract, causing the lock's bolt to rub against the strike plate. We diagnose and solve the root cause, whether it's mechanical or structural."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you fix a lock where the handle sags or won't spring back?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. This is typically a failure of the 'torsion spring' inside the lever or knob. While many locksmiths would suggest a full replacement, we carry internal spring-replacement kits for major brands like Schlage and Kwikset, allowing us to repair the mechanism and save you the cost of new hardware."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it safe to use WD-40 in my locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. WD-40 is a solvent, not a long-term lubricant. It attracts dust and eventually turns into a 'gummy' residue that will seize your pins. We use professional-grade PTFE or graphite spray specifically designed for high-precision mechanical components, ensuring a clean, friction-free operation for years."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you fix a lock if the key broke off inside it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Using surgical-grade extraction tools, we can remove the broken fragment without damaging the internal wafers or pins. In most cases, the lock itself remains perfectly functional once the fragment is removed."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you repair old-fashioned 'Skeleton Key' or Mortise locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. We specialize in the preservation and repair of historic hardware common in the brownstones of Jersey City and Hoboken. We can often source period-correct internal parts to keep your Victorian-era locks functioning as they did in the 1890s."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it better to rekey or replace my locks after moving?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If your lock hardware is in good physical condition and of high quality, rekeying is 100% sufficient and more cost-effective. It involves changing the internal pins so old keys won't work. We recommend replacement only if the locks are Grade 3 (low quality) or showing signs of mechanical fatigue."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a 'Grade 1' lock, and do I need one for my home?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Grade 1 is the highest security rating defined by ANSI/BHMA, typically tested for 1 million cycles and heavy impacts. While most homes use Grade 2, we recommend Grade 1 deadbolts for the primary entry points of North Bergen and Jersey City homes for maximum kick-in resistance."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you make my front door and garage door use the same key?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, this is called 'Keyed Alike.' As long as the lock brands use the same keyway (e.g., both are Schlage or both are Kwikset), we can rekey them to use a single master key for your convenience."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will a smart lock still work if the Wi-Fi goes down?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Most smart locks use Bluetooth for local control or have a physical key override. Wi-Fi is primarily for remote access and notifications. You will never be locked out simply because your internet is down."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What's the difference between a 'Bumping' and 'Picking'?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Picking is a skilled manipulation of pins; 'Bumping' is a brute-force technique using a special key. We install 'Anti-Bump' cylinders that utilize specialized driver pins to neutralize these common residential burglary methods."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why should I replace my locks instead of just rekeying them?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Rekeying only changes the key; it doesn't change the security level of the lock itself. If your home has Grade 3 (low quality) locks, they remain vulnerable to being kicked in or bumped regardless of the key. Replacement allows you to upgrade to Grade 1 or 2 hardware, which provides a significantly higher physical barrier against intruders."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is an ANSI/BHMA Grade, and why does it matter?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and BHMA (Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association) grade locks on strength and durability. Grade 1 is the highest (commercial strength), Grade 2 is for residential security, and Grade 3 is basic. We recommend Grade 1 deadbolts for all primary home entry points to maximize protection."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you replace my old locks with smart locks without changing the door?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In 95% of cases, yes. Modern smart locks are designed to fit standard 'bore holes.' If your door is older or has a non-standard prep, our technicians are equipped to modify the cross-bore on-site to ensure a perfect, secure fit for your new technology."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I know if the replacement lock is 'Bump-Proof'?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Look for locks that utilize 'Anti-Bump' driver pins. These pins are designed to bind or remain stationary during a bump attempt. We primarily install Schlage and Mul-T-Lock cylinders which feature these advanced security measures as standard."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will a new lock stop my door from being kicked in?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A lock is only as strong as its connection to the house frame. During a replacement, we don't just swap the lock; we install reinforced strike plates with 3-inch hardened steel screws that anchored directly into the wall studs, significantly increasing the force required to kick in the door."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why do storage facilities require a locksmith for lockouts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most storage facilities (like Public Storage or Extra Space) do not keep master keys for tenant units for liability reasons. If you lose your key, you are responsible for hiring a licensed locksmith. We provide the facility with the necessary insurance and licensing documentation to perform the work on their property."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a circular 'Disc Lock' be picked?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Disc locks are designed specifically to be pick-resistant and difficult to cut with bolt cutters because of their shielded shackle. While some can be picked by a master locksmith, many require a precision 'Lock-Cracking' technique or a specialized drill-out that only affects the core, allowing the door to open without damaging the unit itself."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What documents do I need for a storage lockout?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You will need a government-issued photo ID that matches the name on the rental agreement. Most facilities also require you to sign a 'Lock Cut Authorization' form in the presence of the manager. We handle the technical side once the facility has cleared you for entry."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My combination lock is jammed. Can you fix it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Usually, a jammed combination lock is due to internal mechanical failure or rust. While we can attempt to decode or lubricate it, we often recommend a 'Non-Destructive Bypass' to get you inside, followed by a replacement with a high-quality keyed disc lock for better reliability in the future."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to open a high-security puck lock?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Hidden-shackle 'puck' locks are among the most secure. Opening one usually takes 15-30 minutes of precision work. We use specialized carbide bits and extraction tools to ensure the unit's hasp remains undamaged."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why should I avoid drilling my lock during a lockout?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Drilling is a destructive, final act. It destroys the cylinder and often damages the internal door mechanism. As master technicians, we prioritize 'Picking' or 'Bypassing.' Not only is this cleaner, but it saves you the cost of buying a new lock and having it rekeyed to your existing system."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do you verify ownership if my ID is locked inside?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is a common scenario. We can verify your identity through digital residents' portals, matching your photo to a social media profile, or by having a neighbor or landlord vouch for you. Once the door is open, we require that you show us your physical ID to finalize the service record."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a professional locksmith open a high-security lock like Mul-T-Lock?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most 'run-of-the-mill' locksmiths cannot. However, Royal Locksmith technicians are trained in advanced manipulation techniques. While these locks are designed to be pick-resistant, we have specialized bypass tools that can often grant access without destroying the high-security core."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will your tools scratch my decorative handleset or paint?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Unlike amateur methods that use pry bars, we use precision picks made of surgical-grade steel and protected shims. Our tools only interact with the internal mechanical components of the lock, leaving the external finish in pristine condition."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you provide receipts for insurance reimbursement?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Many homeowner insurance policies or premium credit cards cover emergency locksmith services. We provide professional, itemized digital receipts that you can submit for reimbursement."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why do standard indoor deadbolts fail on outdoor gates?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Indoor locks are designed for climate-controlled environments. When exposed to NJ's humidity and road salt, internal zinc components oxidize and 'seize.' Furthermore, gates have much larger 'gaps' than doors. We install specialized 'Gate Boxes' or 'Adjustable-Throw' locks that can bridge a 1-2 inch gap and feature weep-holes for moisture drainage."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the NJ requirements for pool gate locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"According to the NJ International Residential Code (IRC), pool gates must be self-closing and self-latching. The latch must be located at least 54 inches from the bottom of the gate to prevent small children from reaching it. We carry specialized 'MagnaLatch' and 'TruClose' hardware that is specifically certified for these safety standards."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use a smart lock on my backyard fence?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, but it must be an 'IP-Rated' weatherproof model. We recommend the Lockey E-910 or specialized outdoor smart boxes from Yale. These feature rubberized gasketing to prevent water from reaching the electronics and are designed to function in temperatures as low as -30°F."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My gate has shifted and the lock no longer matches the hole. Can you fix it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is a common issue caused by NJ's freeze-thaw cycle shifting fence posts. We install 'Adjustable Striker' plates that allow for 1-2 inches of vertical and horizontal play. This means your gate can shift slightly as the seasons change without you ever being locked out."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you install 'Crash Bars' on commercial security gates?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. For apartment complexes or commercial back-access gates, we install outdoor-rated exit devices (panic bars) that allow for emergency egress while maintaining high-security perimeter control."}}]}</script><script>!function(){const e="undefined"!=typeof localStorage&&localStorage.getItem("theme")?localStorage.getItem("theme"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme:

Questions&quot;],&quot;iconName&quot;:[0,&quot;lucide:help-circle&quot;],&quot;faqs&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What locksmith services do you

Our license number is 34LX00010800. All our technicians undergo background checks and continuous training to ensure the highest quality service.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What areas do you serve?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;We proudly serve Northern New Jersey and surrounding communities.

Payment is typically collected after the service is completed to your satisfaction.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer warranties on your work?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we stand behind our work with comprehensive warranties. Parts and labor are typically covered, and the specific warranty period varies by service type. Our technician will explain warranty details before beginning any work.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How do I know if a locksmith is legitimate?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A legitimate locksmith should have a valid state license, arrive in a marked vehicle, provide identification, give a clear quote before starting work, and use professional-grade equipment. You can verify our license number with NJ state licensing authorities.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can I schedule an appointment in advance?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely! While we accommodate urgent requests, we also welcome scheduled appointments. Booking ahead ensures a technician is available at your preferred time. You can schedule online or call our office.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer senior citizen discounts?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we offer discounts for senior citizens, military personnel, and first responders. Please mention your eligibility when scheduling your service, and have appropriate ID ready when the technician arrives.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What brands of locks do you work with?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Our technicians are trained to work with all major lock brands including Schlage, Kwikset, Baldwin, Medeco, Mul-T-Lock, ASSA ABLOY, Yale, and many more.

We offer cleaning, lubrication, adjustment, and inspection services for all types of residential, commercial, and automotive locks.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you help with safe opening and repair?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, our technicians are trained in safe opening, repair, and combination changes. We can help with home safes, gun safes, commercial safes, and vault doors.

We offer professional maintenance services as well.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the difference between rekeying and replacing a lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Rekeying changes the internal pins so old keys no longer work, while keeping the existing hardware. Replacing involves installing an entirely new lock. Rekeying is more cost-effective when your current locks are in good condition.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you provide security consultations?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we offer comprehensive security assessments for homes and businesses.

Ask about our property management programs.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What happens if a key is stuck in the lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A stuck key often indicates worn keys, foreign objects in the lock, or mechanical issues. Our technicians can safely extract the key and diagnose the underlying problem. Avoid forcing the key, as this can cause more damage.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you help with antique or vintage locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we have experience with antique and vintage locks.

While standard business hours offer the most flexibility, we understand that lock problems do not follow a schedule.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How can I improve the security of my front door?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Key improvements include installing a deadbolt if you do not have one, using a reinforced strike plate with 3-inch screws, adding a door reinforcement kit, upgrading to a high-security lock, and ensuring proper door alignment.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a master key system?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A master key system allows one master key to open multiple locks, while individual keys only open their specific lock. This is ideal for businesses, landlords, and homes with multiple entry points. We design custom systems to meet your needs.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you remove and reinstall locks during renovations?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can carefully remove locks before renovation work and reinstall them afterward, or install new locks to match your updated design. We coordinate with contractors to ensure proper timing and security throughout the project.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What should I look for in a high-security lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Look for locks with anti-pick pins, anti-drill plates, reinforced strike plates, bump resistance, and restricted key blanks. UL listings and ANSI commercial grades (1 or 2) indicate higher security levels. We can recommend specific options.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer lock installation for new construction?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we work with builders, contractors, and homeowners on new construction projects.

After a break-in, we can assess the damage, repair or replace compromised locks, rekey all locks, and recommend additional security measures. We also provide documentation for insurance claims.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What are bump-resistant locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Bump-resistant locks have special pin configurations that prevent the bumping technique from working. Many modern high-security locks include this feature. We can assess your current locks and recommend bump-resistant upgrades.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How often should I change my locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Consider changing or rekeying locks when moving to a new home, after a break-in, if keys are lost or stolen, after ending a relationship with someone who had keys, or if locks show signs of wear or damage.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer peephole installation?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install peepholes and door viewers in most door types. Options include standard peepholes, wide-angle viewers, and digital peepholes with screens.

These can be used for insurance claims, tax records, or property management documentation.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the ANSI grading system for locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;ANSI grades rate lock durability and security. Grade 1 is the highest (commercial), Grade 2 is medium (heavy residential), and Grade 3 is standard residential. We can explain which grade is appropriate for your needs.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you install a door reinforcement kit?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, door reinforcement kits strengthen the door frame and add protection against kick-ins. We install complete kits that include frame reinforcement, hinges protection, and upgraded strike plates.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you work with HOAs and condo associations?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we frequently work with HOAs and condo associations on common area locks, master key systems, and individual unit needs. We understand the unique requirements of multi-unit properties.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What brands do you recommend for home security?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;For residential security, we recommend brands like Schlage, Kwikset, and Baldwin for standard needs.

opts={&quot;name&quot;:&quot;FAQCategorySection&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true} prefix=r8 props="{&quot;categoryIndex&quot;:[0,1],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Residential Services&quot;],&quot;iconName&quot;:[0,&quot;lucide:home&quot;],&quot;faqs&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you rekey my locks instead of replacing them?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely! Rekeying is often a cost-effective alternative to full lock replacement. Our technicians can rekey your existing locks so that old keys no longer work, while your current hardware remains in place. This is ideal when moving into a new home or after losing keys.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install smart locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install and service a wide variety of smart locks and electronic access systems. Our technicians are trained on all major brands and can help you choose the right smart lock solution for your home security needs.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you make keys for all types of residential locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;We can create keys for virtually all residential lock types, including standard pin tumbler locks, high-security locks, deadbolts, and more. We use professional-grade equipment to ensure precise key cutting.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What types of deadbolts do you recommend?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;We typically recommend Grade 1 or Grade 2 deadbolts with at least a 1-inch throw bolt. Single-cylinder deadbolts are standard, while double-cylinder options are available for doors with glass. High-security options from Medeco or Mul-T-Lock offer enhanced protection.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you install locks on interior doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install privacy locks for bathrooms and bedrooms, keyed entry locks for home offices, and passage sets for closets and hallways. We can also add key locks to interior doors for additional security.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer whole-house rekeying?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we offer comprehensive whole-house rekeying services. We can rekey all your locks to work with a single key, making it convenient while improving security. This is an excellent choice when moving into a new home.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What smart lock features should I consider?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Consider features like keypad entry, smartphone control, auto-lock, guest codes, activity logging, and integration with home automation systems. Battery backup is important, as is compatibility with your existing door and deadbolt hole.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you repair a stuck or hard-to-turn lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, locks can become stiff due to dirt, worn parts, or misalignment. We can clean, lubricate, adjust, or replace internal components to restore smooth operation. Sometimes, door frame adjustments are needed as well.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install keypad entry systems for homes?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, keypad locks are increasingly popular for homes. They eliminate keys, allow temporary codes for guests or service providers, and many models integrate with smart home systems. We install both standalone and connected keypads.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a bump-proof lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Bump-proof (or bump-resistant) locks use special anti-bump pins or sidebars that prevent the lock from opening when struck with a bump key. Many high-security locks include this feature, and we can recommend options for your home.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you change the locks on my new home?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely. This is one of our most requested services. We can rekey your locks so previous keys no longer work, or install all new locks if you prefer. Many new homeowners choose this for peace of mind.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you repair or replace mailbox locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can open, repair, or replace locks on both wall-mounted and curbside mailboxes. We carry common mailbox lock types and can often match your existing key system.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you install a keyless entry lock on a rental property?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, keyless locks are excellent for rentals because you can easily change codes between tenants without rekeying. Check with your landlord or HOA for any restrictions on lock types before installation.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a Grade 1 lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Grade 1 is the highest ANSI security rating, designed for heavy commercial use but increasingly popular in homes. These locks withstand more abuse, offer better protection against forced entry, and typically last longer than lower grades.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install locks on garage service doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install and service locks on garage service doors (the walk-through door, not the main garage door). We can also add deadbolts for extra security, as these doors are often overlooked entry points.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you help with a door that does not latch properly?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Often, latching issues are caused by misalignment between the door and frame. We can adjust strike plates, plane doors, or shim hinges to restore proper operation. Sometimes the latch mechanism itself needs adjustment or replacement.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a privacy lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Privacy locks are designed for bathrooms and bedrooms. They have a push-button or turn-button lock on the inside but no keyed entry on the outside (just an emergency release slot). They provide privacy without high-security needs.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install French door locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, French doors present unique security challenges. We install multi-point locking systems, flush bolts, and astragal locks to secure both active and passive doors properly.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you add a lock to my bedroom door?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, you can add either a privacy lock (no key, just inside lock) or a keyed entry lock to any bedroom door. We can match the finish and style of your existing hardware throughout the home.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What are decorative door locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Decorative locks combine security with aesthetics, available in various finishes (brushed nickel, oil-rubbed bronze, brass) and styles (traditional, modern, rustic). We can help coordinate your security hardware with your home decor.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install chain locks or door guards?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install surface-mounted chain locks, swing guards, and security latches that allow you to partially open the door while remaining secure. These are useful secondary security devices.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you install a biometric lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install fingerprint-reading biometric locks. These provide keyless convenience and are difficult to bypass. Most biometric locks also have backup entry methods like keypads or key overrides.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a passage lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Passage (or hall/closet) locks have handles or knobs but no locking function. They are used for closets, pantries, and interior doors where privacy and security are not needed but a handle is required.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer lock matching services?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, if you need to match existing lock styles and finishes, we can source hardware that complements what you have. We work with multiple manufacturers to find the best matches.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you install a hotel-style lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Hotel-style (or classroom function) locks are always locked from outside unless unlocked with a key. These are useful for home offices, studies, or any room you want secured by default.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What security upgrades do you recommend for older homes?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Older homes often benefit from new deadbolts, reinforced strike plates with 3-inch screws, frame reinforcement, and upgraded door hinges. Window locks and secondary door security devices also help.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install locks on pet doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, many pet doors have locking mechanisms. We can install pet doors with secure locks or add locking capability to existing pet doors to improve your home security when needed.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you help with door frame repair?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;We handle minor door frame repairs related to lock installation or damage from attempted break-ins. This includes reinforcing damaged jambs, adjusting misaligned frames, and installing frame reinforcement kits.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is keyed alike?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Keyed alike means multiple locks are set to open with the same key. This is convenient for homes with multiple entry points. We can set up new locks keyed alike or rekey existing locks to work together.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install locks on storm doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install and service locks, deadbolts, and multi-point locking systems on storm doors. A secure storm door adds an extra layer of protection for your main entry.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you repair a broken door handle?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can repair or replace broken door handles, knobs, and lever sets. Often the internal mechanism can be repaired without replacing the entire lock set.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a double-cylinder deadbolt?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A double-cylinder deadbolt requires a key to open from both inside and outside. These are used on doors with glass panels to prevent intruders from breaking the glass and reaching in to unlock. Note: they can be a fire safety concern if keys are not accessible.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install locks on gates and fences?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install padlocks, gate latches, and keyed locks on gates and fences. From garden gates to driveway gates, we have solutions to secure perimeter access points.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you rekey locks if I lost all my keys?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, if all keys are lost, we can pick or decode the lock, then rekey it to new keys. No need to replace the entire lock. This is a common service we provide.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What are interchangeable core locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Interchangeable core (IC) locks allow the core to be quickly swapped without disassembling the lock. This makes rekeying very fast. While more common in commercial settings, they can be used in homes for easy key changes.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you sell and install safes?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we sell and install a variety of home safes including fire-resistant safes, gun safes, and wall/floor safes. We can recommend the right safe for your valuables and install it securely.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you change the locks on my apartment?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;If you own the apartment or have landlord permission, yes. Many landlords require approved locksmiths and may need to have a copy of the new key. Always check your lease terms first.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a mortise lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Mortise locks fit into a pocket (mortise) cut into the door edge. They are common in older homes and high-end new construction. We service, repair, and install mortise locks of all types.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install window locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we install keyed window locks, window bars, and secondary security devices for all window types. Securing windows is an important part of overall home security.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you open a locked bedroom door?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, interior door locks are designed for privacy, not security. We can open most bedroom and bathroom doors quickly and without damage, then reset the lock if needed.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the best lock for a front door?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;We recommend a Grade 1 or Grade 2 deadbolt with at least a 1-inch throw, combined with a high-quality handleset. For maximum security, consider high-security cylinders from brands like Medeco or Mul-T-Lock.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install door closers on residential doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, door closers ensure that doors close and latch automatically. While more common commercially, they are useful for garage-to-home doors and other residential applications requiring self-closing.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you secure a hollow-core door?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Hollow-core doors have limited security due to their construction. If replacement is not an option, we can install surface-mounted locks, reinforce the area around the lock, and add secondary security devices.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a lever handle lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Lever handle locks are easier to operate than knobs, especially for those with limited hand strength or mobility. They are ADA-compliant and available in privacy, passage, and keyed entry configurations.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you repair sliding door locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we repair and replace locks on sliding glass doors.

Warranty terms vary by product, and our technician will explain the specific coverage for your installation.&quot;]}]]],&quot;itemsPerPage&quot;:[0,8],&quot;background&quot;:[0,&quot;muted&quot;]}" renderer-url=/_astro/client.DCKK-Ipe.js ssr uid=18XEPi await-children><section class="lg:py-20 py-16 bg-muted/50" id=category-1><div class=container-custom><div class="mx-auto max-w-3xl"><div class="items-center flex gap-4 mb-10"><div class="items-center flex justify-center bg-primary/10 text-primary h-12 rounded-xl w-12"><svg class="lucide h-6 w-6 lucide-house" height=24 width=24 viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true fill=none stroke=currentColor stroke-linecap=round stroke-linejoin=round stroke-width=2 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M15 21v-8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1h-4a1 1 0 0 0-1 1v8"></path><path d="M3 10a2 2 0 0 1 .709-1.528l7-6a2 2 0 0 1 2.582 0l7 6A2 2 0 0 1 21 10v9a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2z"></path></svg></div><h2 class="text-foreground font-bold font-display text-2xl">Residential Services</h2></div><div class="border-border border rounded-2xl divide-border divide-y"><div><button class="items-center flex justify-between text-left w-full duration-300 focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-inset focus-visible:ring-primary hover:bg-muted/50 px-6 py-5 transition-all bg-primary/5 shadow-[inset_4px_0_0_0_theme(colors.primary.500)]" aria-expanded=true aria-controls=accordion-content-cat-1-faq-0 type=button><span class="duration-300 font-bold font-display text-lg tracking-tight transition-colors text-primary">Can you rekey my locks instead of replacing them?</span><span class="items-center flex transition-colors justify-center h-8 rounded-full w-8 bg-primary shadow-glow text-primary-foreground"><svg class="h-5 w-5 lucide lucide-chevron-down" height=24 width=24 viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true fill=none stroke=currentColor stroke-linecap=round stroke-linejoin=round stroke-width=2 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></span></button><div class=overflow-hidden id=accordion-content-cat-1-faq-0 style=height:auto;opacity:1><div class="pt-2 text-muted-foreground pb-4 px-6">Absolutely!

Services&quot;],&quot;iconName&quot;:[0,&quot;lucide:car&quot;],&quot;faqs&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you make keys for newer vehicles with transponders?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we have the equipment and expertise to program transponder keys, smart keys, and key fobs for most vehicle makes and models. Our mobile units carry the necessary tools to provide this service on-site.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What should I do if I am locked out of my car?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;If you are locked out of your vehicle, contact us and our technician will come to your location. We use professional tools and techniques to safely unlock your vehicle without causing damage. Stay in a safe location while waiting.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you replace a lost car key if I do not have a spare?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can create a new key for your vehicle even if you have lost all your keys. We can extract the key code from your vehicle and cut a new key, then program it to work with your car&#39;s immobilizer system.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a transponder key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A transponder key contains a microchip that communicates with your vehicle immobilizer. The car will only start when it detects the correct chip signal. Most vehicles made after 1995 use transponder technology.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you program a new key fob?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we program key fobs for most vehicle makes and models. This includes remote start fobs, proximity keys, and traditional remote keyless entry fobs. We can often do this faster and cheaper than the dealership.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you work on foreign and domestic vehicles?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, our technicians are trained and equipped to work on both domestic (Ford, GM, Chrysler) and foreign (Toyota, Honda, BMW, Mercedes, etc.) vehicles. We stay current on all makes and models.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a smart key or push-button start key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Smart keys (also called proximity keys) allow you to unlock and start your vehicle without removing the key from your pocket or purse. The car detects the key nearby and enables push-button start.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you unlock my trunk?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, whether your keys are locked in the trunk, the trunk release is not working, or you have lost the only key, we can safely open your trunk and resolve the underlying access issue.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you make motorcycle keys?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can cut and program keys for motorcycles, scooters, and ATVs. This includes standard and transponder-equipped bikes from major manufacturers.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What vehicles can you extract key codes from?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;We can extract key codes from most vehicles by reading the VIN, accessing the on-board computer, or decoding the lock. This allows us to create new keys even when all original keys are lost.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you clear my ignition if a broken key is stuck?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can extract broken key fragments from ignitions, door locks, and trunk locks. We use specialized tools to remove the broken piece without damaging the lock cylinder.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you repair car door locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we repair car door locks including cylinders that do not turn, damaged latches, and locks that will not engage. Often we can repair rather than replace, saving you money.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you make a spare car key while I wait?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we offer on-site key cutting and programming. Depending on your vehicle, we can usually provide a fully functional spare key quickly at your location.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the difference between a key fob and a transponder key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A transponder key is a physical key with a chip that must be inserted into the ignition. A key fob is typically a remote device (sometimes with an integrated emergency key) that communicates wirelessly for keyless entry and/or starting.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you program a key I bought online?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Sometimes, but not always. Some aftermarket keys can be programmed, while others may not work with your vehicle. We recommend consulting us before purchasing to ensure compatibility.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you service RVs and trailers?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can create or replace keys for RVs, travel trailers, and fifth wheels. We also service compartment locks, entry doors, and generator locks on recreational vehicles.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you make a key from my VIN number?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;With proof of ownership, we can often obtain the key code from the manufacturer using your VIN. This allows us to cut a key that works, which we then program to your immobilizer.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What if my car key battery dies?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Weak key fob batteries can prevent remote functions and sometimes prevent the car from recognizing the key for push-button start. We can replace batteries and test fob function. Most vehicles have backup start methods too.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer emergency car lockout services?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, car lockouts are one of our most common services. We respond to locked-out situations at your location, whether at home, work, or on the roadside.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you rekey my car ignition?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Rekeying car ignitions is complex and often not cost-effective. In most cases, replacing the ignition lock cylinder with a new one and programming new keys is the better solution.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is an ignition lock cylinder?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;The ignition lock cylinder is the part of the ignition where you insert your key. It can wear out, get stuck, or be damaged. We can repair or replace ignition cylinders for most vehicles.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you unlock a frozen car door lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can safely thaw and unlock frozen locks using proper techniques and de-icers. We can also lubricate locks to prevent future freezing and provide tips for prevention.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you work on classic and vintage cars?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can cut keys, repair locks, and address security needs for classic and vintage vehicles. Older vehicles often use simpler lock systems, but finding parts can require resourcefulness.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you replace a car lock cylinder?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can replace door lock and ignition cylinders if they are worn, damaged, or if you want them rekeyed to new keys. We source cylinders for most makes and models.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a valet key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A valet key is a limited-function key that typically unlocks the door and starts the car but cannot open the trunk or glove compartment. We can produce valet keys for many vehicles.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you provide locksmith services for fleet vehicles?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we work with businesses that have vehicle fleets. We can provide key replacements, lockout services, and lock repairs for commercial vehicles, often with priority scheduling.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you reprogram my existing key if I replaced the battery?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Usually, replacing the battery does not require reprogramming. If your key stops working after a battery change, there may be another issue. We can diagnose and resolve key and fob problems.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the difference between key cutting and key programming?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Cutting creates the physical key blade to fit the lock. Programming tells the vehicle computer to accept the transponder chip. Most modern keys require both cutting AND programming to work.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you unlock a car with the keys inside without damaging it?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we use professional tools and techniques specifically designed to unlock vehicles without damage. We never use methods that could harm your weatherstripping, paint, or lock mechanisms.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you make heavy equipment keys?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we make and replace keys for construction and agricultural equipment including excavators, tractors, loaders, and skid steers. Many use standard cross-reference keys we stock.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you disable a lost key&#39;s transponder?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, if you still have one working key and lose another, we can reprogram the vehicle to only accept the remaining key(s), disabling the lost key&#39;s chip. This is important for security.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What should I bring for automotive locksmith service?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Please have your driver&#39;s license and vehicle registration available to verify ownership. This is standard practice to ensure we are providing access to the vehicle&#39;s rightful owner.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you repair the lock on my truck camper shell?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can repair, rekey, or replace locks on camper shells and truck caps. We can often key them to match your vehicle&#39;s ignition key for convenience.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer roadside automotive locksmith service?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, all our automotive services are mobile. We come to your location whether you are at home, at work, in a parking lot, or on the roadside.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you make a key for a car with no working key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, this is called key origination. We extract the key code from the vehicle, cut a new key, and program it to the immobilizer—all without needing any existing keys.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What makes dealer key replacement so expensive?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Dealers often have higher overhead, must order parts, and may charge diagnostic fees. Locksmiths specialize in keys and carry programming equipment and blanks, allowing us to offer competitive rates.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you duplicate a car key without the original?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;With proof of ownership, yes. If you do not have the original key, we obtain the key code from the vehicle or manufacturer database and create a new key from scratch.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you service commercial trucks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we work on commercial trucks including semi-trucks, box trucks, and delivery vehicles. We can handle keys, ignitions, and lock systems for commercial vehicles.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you add a remote start to my vehicle?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;While our primary focus is locks and keys, some of our technicians can install remote start systems. Contact us to discuss your specific vehicle and remote start options.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is an immobilizer bypass?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Immobilizer bypass is a method to start a vehicle when the immobilizer system is faulty (not for theft). This is sometimes used diagnostically or when keys cannot be immediately programmed.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you make keys for boat trailers?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we can make or replace keys for trailer hitch locks, tongue locks, and coupler locks. We can often key them alike for convenience.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you work on hybrid and electric vehicles?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, hybrid and electric vehicles use key systems similar to conventional cars. We can cut keys, program fobs, and handle lockouts for Tesla, Prius, Leaf, and other EVs.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you help if my car remote is not working?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we troubleshoot remote issues including dead batteries, sync problems, and damaged remotes. We can replace batteries, reprogram remotes, or replace faulty units.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is key programming by OBD?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) programming uses your vehicle&#39;s diagnostic port to communicate with the immobilizer computer and add new key data. This is the standard method for most programming.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you service car locks damaged in break-in attempts?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we repair and replace locks damaged by break-in attempts. We can restore your vehicle&#39;s security and provide locks that resist similar attacks in the future.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you provide emergency jump-starts too?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Our primary expertise is locks and keys. For jump-starts and other roadside assistance, we recommend contacting a full roadside service provider, though we can sometimes assist.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What information do you need to make a car key remotely?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;To provide remote consultation, we need the year, make, model, and VIN of your vehicle. We can then advise on key options, pricing, and schedule an on-site visit.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you match a new door lock to my existing key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, if we are replacing a door lock, we can often pin the new lock to match your existing ignition key. This gives you a single key for doors and ignition.&quot;]}]]],&quot;itemsPerPage&quot;:[0,8],&quot;background&quot;:[0,&quot;muted&quot;]}" renderer-url=/_astro/client.DCKK-Ipe.js ssr uid=Z2axcIE await-children><section class="lg:py-20 py-16 bg-muted/50" id=category-3><div class=container-custom><div class="mx-auto max-w-3xl"><div class="items-center flex gap-4 mb-10"><div class="items-center flex justify-center bg-primary/10 text-primary h-12 rounded-xl w-12"><svg class="lucide h-6 w-6 lucide-car" height=24 width=24 viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true fill=none stroke=currentColor stroke-linecap=round stroke-linejoin=round stroke-width=2 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M19 17h2c.6 0 1-.4 1-1v-3c0-.9-.7-1.7-1.5-1.9C18.7 10.6 16 10 16 10s-1.3-1.4-2.2-2.3c-.5-.4-1.1-.7-1.8-.7H5c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.4.9l-1.4 2.9A3.7 3.7 0 0 0 2 12v4c0 .6.4 1 1 1h2"></path><circle cx=7 cy=17 r=2></circle><path d="M9 17h6"></path><circle cx=17 cy=17 r=2></circle></svg></div><h2 class="text-foreground font-bold font-display text-2xl">Automotive Services</h2></div><div class="border-border border rounded-2xl divide-border divide-y"><div><button class="items-center flex justify-between text-left w-full duration-300 focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-inset focus-visible:ring-primary hover:bg-muted/50 px-6 py-5 transition-all bg-primary/5 shadow-[inset_4px_0_0_0_theme(colors.primary.500)]" aria-expanded=true aria-controls=accordion-content-cat-3-faq-0 type=button><span class="duration-300 font-bold font-display text-lg tracking-tight transition-colors text-primary">Can you make keys for newer vehicles with transponders?</span><span class="items-center flex transition-colors justify-center h-8 rounded-full w-8 bg-primary shadow-glow text-primary-foreground"><svg class="h-5 w-5 lucide lucide-chevron-down" height=24 width=24 viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true fill=none stroke=currentColor stroke-linecap=round stroke-linejoin=round stroke-width=2 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></span></button><div class=overflow-hidden id=accordion-content-cat-3-faq-0 style=height:auto;opacity:1><div class="pt-2 text-muted-foreground pb-4 px-6">Yes, we have the equipment and expertise to program transponder keys, smart keys, and key fobs for most vehicle makes and models.

opts={&quot;name&quot;:&quot;FAQCategorySection&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true} prefix=r13 props="{&quot;categoryIndex&quot;:[0,6],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Service-Specific Questions&quot;],&quot;iconName&quot;:[0,&quot;lucide:wrench&quot;],&quot;faqs&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How do you verify authorization for a commercial lockout in NJ?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Commercial security requires strict protocol. We verify authorization through a combination of Photo ID and business documentation (e.g., an occupational license, a lease agreement, or being listed as an authorized contact on the building&#39;s management directory). For high-security facilities, we often require a verbal confirmation from the business owner or property manager.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you open a door with a &#39;Panic Bar&#39; from the outside?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Most commercial exit devices (Von Duprin, Detex, Jackson) have an external keyed trim. If you&#39;ve lost the key, we can pick the cylinder or use specialized &#39;Over-the-Door&#39; tools that interact with the internal panic bar lever, granting access without damaging the fire-rated integrity of the door.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What should I do if my electronic key card system has failed?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Electronic failures are often caused by power surges or battery depletion in the backup unit. We provide mechanical overrides for most electronic strikes and magnetic locks. Once inside, we can also assist in diagnosing the power failure to prevent future lockouts.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Our storefront has a glass door with an &#39;Adams Rite&#39; lock. Can you open it?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Storefront glass doors use a specific &#39;swinging-bolt&#39; or &#39;deadlatch&#39; mechanism. We carry specialized tools that can bypass these without shattering the tempered glass or scratching the aluminum frame. We are experts in servicing the unique security needs of Hudson County retail hubs.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer &#39;Master Key&#39; overrides for property managers?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. If a master key is lost, we can assist in gaining entry to any unit in your building and then perform a master-key rekeying service to invalidate the lost key and restore security to your entire property.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can a locksmith make a key for a modern car with a chip?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Unlike hardware stores that can only cut simple metal keys, we carry advanced OBD-II programming computers that can sync encrypted transponder chips with your vehicle&#39;s ECU. We can generate high-security keys for 98% of vehicles on the road.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why is the dealership charging so much for a replacement fob?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Dealerships often have high overhead and charge &#39;premium&#39; rates for programming. They also usually require you to tow the car to them. We bring the &#39;dealership&#39; to you, cutting out the tow fee and typically saving you 30-50% on the key itself.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is an EEPROM car key service?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Some European vehicles (BMW, VW, Audi) require &#39;EEPROM&#39; programming, where we safely read the data directly from the car&#39;s computer chip rather than the OBD port. We are among the few locksmiths in NJ certified for this advanced level of automotive security.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you replace a car key if I don&#39;t have the original code?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely. We can pull your key code directly from the vehicle&#39;s VIN or by de-coding the physical wafers inside your door lock. You do not need the original dealer code for us to help you.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Will a new key automatically disable my lost ones?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;In most modern &#39;Proximity&#39; or &#39;Push-to-Start&#39; systems, we can perform a &#39;Key Deletion&#39; during the programming process. This wipes the lost key from the car&#39;s memory, ensuring that even if someone finds it, they cannot start your vehicle.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the difference between &#39;Fail-Safe&#39; and &#39;Fail-Secure&#39; locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is a critical distinction for fire safety. A &#39;Fail-Safe&#39; lock (like a Magnetic Lock) releases when power is lost, allowing for immediate exit. A &#39;Fail-Secure&#39; lock (like an Electric Strike) remains locked from the outside when power is lost but allows a mechanical handle to open the door from the inside. We ensure your system is configured to meet NJ State Fire Codes.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can we use our iPhones or Apple Watches to unlock the office doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Modern systems utilize &#39;Mobile Credentials&#39; via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Near Field Communication (NFC). Users can simply tap their phone or even just approach the door with their phone in their pocket to gain access. This eliminates the cost and hassle of physical plastic cards.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can I manage access for three different NJ locations from one portal?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely. Our Cloud-Based platforms (like Brivo or Openpath) are designed for multi-site management. You can manage a warehouse in Secaucus, a retail store in North Bergen, and an office in Jersey City all from a single dashboard, with unified user profiles across all locations.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What happens if our internet goes out? Will the doors stop working?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;No. Professional access control &#39;Controllers&#39; have internal memory that stores a copy of the authorized database. If the cloud connection is lost, the doors will continue to operate normally for all existing users. The system will then &#39;sync&#39; the audit logs to the cloud once the connection is restored.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How does biometrics (fingerprint/face) work with employee privacy laws?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Professional biometric readers do not store an &#39;image&#39; of the finger or face. Instead, they convert the biological measurements into an encrypted mathematical &#39;template.&#39; This template cannot be used to reconstruct a fingerprint, protecting your employees&#39; privacy while providing unbreakable security.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the difference between &#39;Cloning&#39; and &#39;Programming&#39; a key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Cloning makes an exact digital &#39;twin&#39; of your existing key. The car thinks the clone IS the original. Programming involves adding a brand-new ID to a specific slot in your vehicle&#39;s computer. Cloning is the faster and safer method for many older cars, while Programming is required for most modern smart-fob systems. We choose the optimal method based on your car&#39;s specific security architecture.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can a hardware store duplicate my car key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Standard hardware stores can only duplicate basic metal keys. They lack the expensive diagnostic computers required to communicate with a car&#39;s immobilizer. Even &#39;Automated Kiosks&#39; often fail to correctly program the chip or handle laser-cut keys. As automotive specialists, we guarantee a 100% functional key with both mechanical and electronic integrity.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Is it better to have two different fobs or two &#39;Clones&#39; of the same fob?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;For modern vehicles, having two separate programmed IDs is superior. If one key is lost and later found, we can disable only the lost ID. If you have two clones and lose one, we have to wipe and reset the entire system. We recommend native programming for all vehicles newer than 2015.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How long does a car key duplication take on-site?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A standard transponder key takes about 15-20 minutes. A high-security smart fob for a luxury vehicle may take 30-40 minutes as the car&#39;s computer often requires a &#39;timed security delay&#39; before allowing us to enter the programming interface.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;My original key is worn and sticking. Will a duplicate also stick?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Not if we do it. Instead of tracing your worn key (which would just replicate the damage), we use our &#39;Optical Decoder&#39; to determine the original factory cuts (the &#39;bitting&#39;). We then cut a fresh key to the original factory specifications, which often works better than your current worn-out original.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Will unlocking my car with professional tools damage the air bags?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely not. Modern vehicles have Side Impact Airbags (SABs) located in the door pillars or seats. Amateur &#39;slim-jim&#39; methods can trip these sensors or snag wiring. Our NDE (Non-Destructive Entry) methods use the lock cylinder or internal handle, completely bypassing the airbag deployment zones.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why can&#39;t I just use a wire hanger like in the movies?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Modern cars (post-1995) have internal shielding around the lock rods specifically to prevent &#39;coat hanger&#39; entry. Attempting this will likely pull the weather stripping off or, worse, disconnect the lock linkage, turning a simple lockout into an expensive mechanical repair.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a Lishi tool and why is it better?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A Lishi tool is a precision instrument that we insert into your lock cylinder. It allows us to &#39;decode&#39; and &#39;pick&#39; each individual wafer in the lock simultaneously. It is the gold standard for damage-free entry because it never touches your car&#39;s body or window seals.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;I locked my keys in the trunk, and my car has no trunk button. Can you help?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Many luxury cars disable the interior trunk release when the alarm is active. We use a method called &#39;Lock Decoding&#39; to read the bitting of the door lock and then use a specialized machine to cut a temporary &#39;service key&#39; that opens your trunk mechanically.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you service lockouts in parking garages or major NJ malls?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. We frequently respond to the American Dream Mall, Jersey Gardens, and Willowbrook Mall. Our compact mobile units can enter most low-clearance parking garages to assist you at your vehicle&#39;s location.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How can you make a key if I don&#39;t have the original?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is the difference between a high-tech automotive locksmith and a hardware store booth. We use a &#39;Lishi&#39; tool or a &#39;Scope&#39; to decode the internal wafers of your door lock. This gives us the &#39;Bitting Code.&#39; We then cross-reference your VIN with the manufacturer&#39;s database to verify the correct electronic transponder profile before cutting and programming a fresh key from scratch.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why does the dealership say it takes 3 days to get a key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Dealerships often do not have on-site key cutters or EEPROM programmers. They typically order pre-cut keys from a central warehouse based on your VIN. As a mobile automotive specialist, we carry blank &#39;Smart Keys&#39; for almost every major make (Honda, Toyota, BMW, Ford, etc.) and perform the cutting and programming right next to your car.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a Transponder Chip, and why is it necessary?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Since the late 1990s, cars have an &#39;Immobilizer System.&#39; The key head contains a tiny passive RFID chip. When you turn the ignition, the car&#39;s computer (ECU) sends a pulse. The chip must respond with a matched encrypted code. If it doesn&#39;t, the fuel pump is disabled. We program this specific handshake on-site.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you make keys for high-end European brands like BMW or Mercedes?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Unlike many locksmiths, we specialize in European &#39;CAS&#39; and &#39;EIS&#39; systems. These require advanced bench-programming (EEPROM) where we read the data directly from the car&#39;s security module. This allows us to provide keys for BMW, Mercedes, Audi, and VW at a portion of the dealer&#39;s cost.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Will my new key also work my remote buttons (Lock/Unlock)?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely. When we program a &#39;Remote Head&#39; or &#39;Smart Fob,&#39; we ensure all functions are synchronized—including proximity entry, push-to-start, trunk release, and panic buttons.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is an SFIC (Small Format Interchangeable Core) system?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;SFIC is a standard in commercial locksmithing where the lock cylinder (the &#39;core&#39;) can be removed using a special &#39;control key&#39; without taking the entire lock off the door. This allows a facility manager to rekey a door in 3 seconds. We specialize in Best, Falcon, and Arrow SFIC profiles for major NJ office complexes.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why can&#39;t I use residential locks on my business doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Beyond the obvious security vulnerability, residential locks are not fire-rated for commercial use and do not meet ADA (Americans with Disabilities) requirements for &#39;unassisted egress.&#39; Furthermore, a residential lock will typically fail within months if subjected to the high-frequency use of a retail storefront.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Are your commercial locks fire-rated?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. For stairwell doors and corridor entry points, we exclusively install UL-Listed, 3-hour fire-rated hardware. We ensure that the lock and the strike plate do not compromise the &#39;Listing&#39; of your fire-rated door assembly, keeping you in compliance with NJ State Fire Marshall requirements.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you replace locks on aluminum storefront glass doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Storefront doors use a specific &#39;narrow-stile&#39; mortise lock (typically Adams Rite). These require specialized technical adjustment of the drive-cam and pivoting bolt. We carry all necessary configurations, including electrified versions for remote buzzing-in.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How do you handle lock replacement for high-turnover businesses?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;For retail and hospitality, we recommend either SFIC systems or cloud-managed electronic locks. These allow you to invalidate previous employee access immediately, reducing the long-term cost of locksmith visits.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the difference between &#39;Panic Hardware&#39; and &#39;Fire Exit Hardware&#39;?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is a critical distinction in NJ building codes. &#39;Panic Hardware&#39; features a dogging mechanism (allowing the bar to be locked in the retracted position). This cannot be used on fire-rated doors. &#39;Fire Exit Hardware&#39; is UL-Listed for fire doors and must be &#39;positive latching&#39; at all times to prevent the door from bowing and allowing the spread of smoke during a fire.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Are &#39;Vertical Rod&#39; exit devices necessary for all double doors?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;If your double doors do not have a center post (mullion), then at least one door (usually both) must have vertical rods to secure the door at the top and bottom. We specialize in both surface-mounted and concealed vertical rods (CVR), ensuring that your double doors remain secure against forced entry while providing easy egress.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can we install a panic bar that alerts us when someone uses the back door?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, we frequently install &#39;Alarmed Exit Devices&#39; (like the Detex Advantex series). These units feature a 100dB+ siren that triggers if the bar is pushed. This is the industry standard for retail stockrooms and back-of-house areas, providing fire-legal egress while preventing internal and external theft.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Our panic bar is &#39;dragging&#39; on the floor. Can it be repaired?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Usually, this is a timing or alignment issue with the vertical rods or a sagging hinge. We are experts in &#39;Timing&#39; commercial hardware. We&#39;ll adjust the top and bottom latches to ensure they retract fully when the bar is pushed, preventing floor drag and ensuring a smooth, compliant operation.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is &#39;Delayed Egress&#39; hardware?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Delayed egress devices (NFPA 101 compliant) sound an alarm and delay the door from opening for 15 seconds after someone pushes the bar. This is used in healthcare and retail to prevent &#39;Dash and Grab&#39; theft or wandering patients, while still unlocking automatically if the fire alarm is triggered.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How does a master key system improve business security?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A master key system reduces &#39;key creep.&#39; Instead of employees carrying 10 keys, they carry 1 that only opens their authorized zones. By using restricted keyways, we also prevent unauthorized key duplication at hardware stores, ensuring you have 100% control over who has access.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What are the ADA requirements for commercial door hardware in NJ?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all commercial door hardware must be operable with one hand and not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. This typically means replacing knob locks with lever-style handles. We ensure all your exterior and interior doors meet these federal standards.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can I manage my business access control from my smartphone?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely. We specialize in cloud-based access control systems. You can lock/unlock doors, add or delete employee credentials, and view entry logs in real-time from anywhere in the world using your mobile device.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a &#39;Panic Bar&#39; and is it required for my storefront?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A panic bar (or rim exit device) allows for immediate egress during an emergency. In NJ, if your building has a certain occupancy load or is a specific type of business (like a restaurant or school), fire codes mandate these devices. We provide code-compliant installation and testing.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you offer &#39;After-Hours&#39; service for commercial emergencies?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. We understand that a broken storefront lock or a failed security gate at 10 PM is a liability. We provide 24/7 priority emergency response for our commercial clients throughout Northern New Jersey.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How long does it take for an emergency locksmith to arrive?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;In Northern NJ, particularly Hudson and Bergen Counties, our average arrival time is promptly. We use a real-time GPS dispatch system to send the technician physically closest to your location.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Will unlocking my car damage the power locks or windows?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;No. Unlike amateur &#39;slim-jim&#39; methods that can pull wires or damage weather-stripping, we use precision air-wedges and long-reach tools that never touch your internal door mechanics.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can a locksmith open a high-security lock like Mul-T-Lock or Medeco?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Most emergency locksmiths cannot. However, Royal Locksmith technicians carry specialized picking tools for high-security cylinders. While these take longer than standard locks, we can often bypass them without drilling.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What if my key is broken inside the lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Don&#39;t try to pull it out yourself—you&#39;ll likely push it deeper. We use surgical-grade extraction tools to remove the broken blade without replacing the entire cylinder.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you service lockouts during blizzards or holidays?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Our mobile fleet is equipped for all weather conditions. We remain fully operational 365 days a year, including holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why is my key fob suddenly not being recognized by my car?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is often due to a &#39;Rolling Code&#39; desynchronization. For security, fobs and cars change their &#39;code&#39; every time a button is pressed. If the fob is pressed many times away from the car, or if the car&#39;s battery died, they may lose their &#39;sync.&#39; We use an OBD-II interface to &#39;re-introduce&#39; the security seed to both the fob and the Body Control Module (BCM).&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you program a key fob I bought on eBay or Amazon?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;We can certainly try, but with a warning: many online fobs are &#39;Locked&#39; (previously paired with another car) or use low-quality frequencies that the car&#39;s computer will reject. We carry a massive inventory of &#39;Virgin&#39; fobs that are guaranteed to program successfully the first time.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What should I do if my smart key dies and I&#39;m locked out?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Every smart key fob has a hidden mechanical &#39;Emergency Blade&#39; inside. There is also a hidden keyhole on your car door (sometimes behind a plastic cap). Once inside, most cars have a &#39;Backup Slot&#39; or you simply hold the fob directly against the Start button to allow a passive transponder handshake to start the engine. We can show you this process during your service.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you program a second fob so my spouse and I each have one?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. In fact, we recommend it. Many modern cars require at least two programmed keys in the memory to perform certain diagnostic resets or for insurance &#39;All Keys Lost&#39; protection. We can program as many as your car&#39;s computer allows (usually up to 8).&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How much cheaper is a locksmith than the dealership for fob programming?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Typically, we are 30-50% more affordable. More importantly, we save you the &#39;Dealership Tax&#39; of towing your car and waiting days for a service appointment. We come to you and complete the job in 20-30 minutes.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the difference between a &#39;Master Key&#39; and a &#39;Grand Master Key&#39;?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;In a hierarchical system, a &#39;Master Key&#39; typically opens a specific department or section (e.g., all 2nd-floor offices). A &#39;Grand Master Key&#39; is one level higher, opening every lock in the entire facility across all departments. We can even add a &#39;Great Grand Master&#39; for multi-building campuses.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How safe is a master key system? Can it be easily picked?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A master-keyed lock technically has more shear lines (potential opening points) than a single-keyed lock. However, when designed by a professional, this does not significantly reduce picking resistance. For maximum security, we recommend master-keying high-security cylinders like Medeco or Mul-T-Lock, which are virtually pick-proof regardless of the master pinning.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you implement a master key system on my existing locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;If your locks are of the same brand or share a compatible keyway (like Schlage C), we can typically re-pin them into a master system. If your building has a mix of incompatible brands, we may recommend replacing the cylinders with a unified SFIC or high-security system to achieve a single-key solution.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is &#39;Cross-Keying&#39; and why is it dangerous?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Cross-keying occurs when a lock is pinned to respond to key codes from different branches of the hierarchy that shouldn&#39;t match. This &#39;Ghosting&#39; can happen in amateur systems, where a key intended for Room A accidentally opens Room B. Our precision software-designed charts eliminate these mathematical errors.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How do restricted keyways protect my business?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Standard keys can be copied at any automated kiosk or hardware store. Restricted keyways use patent-protected blanks that are only distributed to authorized locksmiths. We hold the registration for your specific key profile, ensuring that only people with your signed authorization can ever obtain a duplicate.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why is my car key suddenly not turning in the ignition?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is usually caused by &#39;wafer collapse&#39; or metal fatigue. High-security keys (like Honda and Ford) use tiny brass wafers. Over 5-10 years, these wafers wear down or bend, preventing the cylinder from reaching the &#39;shear line.&#39; If you have to jiggle your key, the ignition is failing. We can rebuild the cylinder with fresh, reinforced wafers on-site.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;If you replace my ignition, will I need a new set of keys?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;No. Unlike a dealership that will simply give you a new ignition with a new key code (meaning your old keys won&#39;t open your doors), we perform &#39;Ignition Re-Pinning.&#39; We disassemble the new cylinder and match its internal configuration to your original key profile. This maintains a &#39;One Key&#39; system for your vehicle.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can a stuck key in the ignition drain my battery?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. If the key is stuck in the &#39;ACC&#39; (Accessory) or &#39;ON&#39; position, your car&#39;s electrical systems remain active. If we cannot reach you immediately, we recommend disconnecting the negative battery terminal. We can then extract the key and repair the locking mechanism without any further electrical damage.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is the difference between the ignition &#39;Cylinder&#39; and the ignition &#39;Switch&#39;?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;The **Cylinder** is the mechanical part where you insert the key. The **Switch** is the electrical component behind it that sends power to the starter. If your key turns but the car doesn&#39;t CRANK, it&#39;s usually the switch. If the key won&#39;t even rotate, it&#39;s the cylinder. We carry replacement parts for both.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;My steering wheel is locked and the key won&#39;t turn. Is my ignition broken?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Not necessarily. This is often &#39;Steering Lock Binding.&#39; If you parked with your wheels turned, the steering column is putting pressure on the ignition bolt. Try turning the steering wheel firmly to the left and right while simultaneously attempting to turn the key. If it still won&#39;t budge, the internal locking pin may be seized, requiring our intervention.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;If I rekey my lock, does the old key still work?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;No. The rekeying process involves removing the internal pins and replacing them with a new set of varying heights. Once the cylinder is reassembled with the new pins, the old key will no longer align with the shear line, making it physically impossible for the old key to rotate the lock.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Is rekeying as secure as getting new locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, from an access control perspective. If your existing locks are physically robust (Grade 1 or 2), rekeying is perfectly secure. However, if your locks are old, rusted, or of low quality, replacing them with a higher-grade model would be the better security choice.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you rekey different brands of locks to the same key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is a common question. You can only &#39;Key Alike&#39; locks that share the same &#39;Keyway&#39; (the shape of the key hole). For example, you can rekey a Schlage deadbolt and an Emtek handleset to the same key because they both use the &#39;SC1&#39; keyway. You cannot rekey a Kwikset to a Schlage key without replacing the entire cylinder.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How long does it take for a locksmith to rekey a whole house?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A standard 3-bedroom home with 5 or 6 locks typically takes 45 to 90 minutes. This includes removing the cylinders, re-pinning them, cutting the new keys, and testing the operation of every door.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a &#39;Master Key&#39; system for a house?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A master key system allows one &#39;Grand Master&#39; key to open every door, while other keys (like one for a tenant or a cleaning service) only open specific doors. We can design these multi-tier access systems for your home on the spot.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why is my key suddenly difficult to turn in the lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is usually caused by one of three things: internal debris/grit, an unlubricated cylinder whereby the pins are dragging, or most commonly, a slight misalignment between the door and the frame. As the seasons change in NJ, wood doors expand and contract, causing the lock&#39;s bolt to rub against the strike plate. We diagnose and solve the root cause, whether it&#39;s mechanical or structural.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you fix a lock where the handle sags or won&#39;t spring back?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. This is typically a failure of the &#39;torsion spring&#39; inside the lever or knob. While many locksmiths would suggest a full replacement, we carry internal spring-replacement kits for major brands like Schlage and Kwikset, allowing us to repair the mechanism and save you the cost of new hardware.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Is it safe to use WD-40 in my locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;No. WD-40 is a solvent, not a long-term lubricant. It attracts dust and eventually turns into a &#39;gummy&#39; residue that will seize your pins. We use professional-grade PTFE or graphite spray specifically designed for high-precision mechanical components, ensuring a clean, friction-free operation for years.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you fix a lock if the key broke off inside it?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Using surgical-grade extraction tools, we can remove the broken fragment without damaging the internal wafers or pins. In most cases, the lock itself remains perfectly functional once the fragment is removed.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you repair old-fashioned &#39;Skeleton Key&#39; or Mortise locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Absolutely. We specialize in the preservation and repair of historic hardware common in the brownstones of Jersey City and Hoboken. We can often source period-correct internal parts to keep your Victorian-era locks functioning as they did in the 1890s.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Is it better to rekey or replace my locks after moving?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;If your lock hardware is in good physical condition and of high quality, rekeying is 100% sufficient and more cost-effective. It involves changing the internal pins so old keys won&#39;t work. We recommend replacement only if the locks are Grade 3 (low quality) or showing signs of mechanical fatigue.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a &#39;Grade 1&#39; lock, and do I need one for my home?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Grade 1 is the highest security rating defined by ANSI/BHMA, typically tested for 1 million cycles and heavy impacts. While most homes use Grade 2, we recommend Grade 1 deadbolts for the primary entry points of North Bergen and Jersey City homes for maximum kick-in resistance.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you make my front door and garage door use the same key?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, this is called &#39;Keyed Alike.&#39; As long as the lock brands use the same keyway (e.g., both are Schlage or both are Kwikset), we can rekey them to use a single master key for your convenience.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Will a smart lock still work if the Wi-Fi goes down?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Most smart locks use Bluetooth for local control or have a physical key override. Wi-Fi is primarily for remote access and notifications. You will never be locked out simply because your internet is down.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What&#39;s the difference between a &#39;Bumping&#39; and &#39;Picking&#39;?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Picking is a skilled manipulation of pins; &#39;Bumping&#39; is a brute-force technique using a special key. We install &#39;Anti-Bump&#39; cylinders that utilize specialized driver pins to neutralize these common residential burglary methods.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why should I replace my locks instead of just rekeying them?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Rekeying only changes the key; it doesn&#39;t change the security level of the lock itself. If your home has Grade 3 (low quality) locks, they remain vulnerable to being kicked in or bumped regardless of the key. Replacement allows you to upgrade to Grade 1 or 2 hardware, which provides a significantly higher physical barrier against intruders.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What is an ANSI/BHMA Grade, and why does it matter?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and BHMA (Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association) grade locks on strength and durability. Grade 1 is the highest (commercial strength), Grade 2 is for residential security, and Grade 3 is basic. We recommend Grade 1 deadbolts for all primary home entry points to maximize protection.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can you replace my old locks with smart locks without changing the door?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;In 95% of cases, yes. Modern smart locks are designed to fit standard &#39;bore holes.&#39; If your door is older or has a non-standard prep, our technicians are equipped to modify the cross-bore on-site to ensure a perfect, secure fit for your new technology.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How do I know if the replacement lock is &#39;Bump-Proof&#39;?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Look for locks that utilize &#39;Anti-Bump&#39; driver pins. These pins are designed to bind or remain stationary during a bump attempt. We primarily install Schlage and Mul-T-Lock cylinders which feature these advanced security measures as standard.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Will a new lock stop my door from being kicked in?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;A lock is only as strong as its connection to the house frame. During a replacement, we don&#39;t just swap the lock; we install reinforced strike plates with 3-inch hardened steel screws that anchored directly into the wall studs, significantly increasing the force required to kick in the door.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why do storage facilities require a locksmith for lockouts?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Most storage facilities (like Public Storage or Extra Space) do not keep master keys for tenant units for liability reasons. If you lose your key, you are responsible for hiring a licensed locksmith. We provide the facility with the necessary insurance and licensing documentation to perform the work on their property.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can a circular &#39;Disc Lock&#39; be picked?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Disc locks are designed specifically to be pick-resistant and difficult to cut with bolt cutters because of their shielded shackle. While some can be picked by a master locksmith, many require a precision &#39;Lock-Cracking&#39; technique or a specialized drill-out that only affects the core, allowing the door to open without damaging the unit itself.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What documents do I need for a storage lockout?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;You will need a government-issued photo ID that matches the name on the rental agreement. Most facilities also require you to sign a &#39;Lock Cut Authorization&#39; form in the presence of the manager. We handle the technical side once the facility has cleared you for entry.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;My combination lock is jammed. Can you fix it?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Usually, a jammed combination lock is due to internal mechanical failure or rust. While we can attempt to decode or lubricate it, we often recommend a &#39;Non-Destructive Bypass&#39; to get you inside, followed by a replacement with a high-quality keyed disc lock for better reliability in the future.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How long does it take to open a high-security puck lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Hidden-shackle &#39;puck&#39; locks are among the most secure. Opening one usually takes 15-30 minutes of precision work. We use specialized carbide bits and extraction tools to ensure the unit&#39;s hasp remains undamaged.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why should I avoid drilling my lock during a lockout?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Drilling is a destructive, final act. It destroys the cylinder and often damages the internal door mechanism. As master technicians, we prioritize &#39;Picking&#39; or &#39;Bypassing.&#39; Not only is this cleaner, but it saves you the cost of buying a new lock and having it rekeyed to your existing system.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;How do you verify ownership if my ID is locked inside?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is a common scenario. We can verify your identity through digital residents&#39; portals, matching your photo to a social media profile, or by having a neighbor or landlord vouch for you. Once the door is open, we require that you show us your physical ID to finalize the service record.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can a professional locksmith open a high-security lock like Mul-T-Lock?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Most &#39;run-of-the-mill&#39; locksmiths cannot. However, Royal Locksmith technicians are trained in advanced manipulation techniques. While these locks are designed to be pick-resistant, we have specialized bypass tools that can often grant access without destroying the high-security core.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Will your tools scratch my decorative handleset or paint?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;No. Unlike amateur methods that use pry bars, we use precision picks made of surgical-grade steel and protected shims. Our tools only interact with the internal mechanical components of the lock, leaving the external finish in pristine condition.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you provide receipts for insurance reimbursement?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. Many homeowner insurance policies or premium credit cards cover emergency locksmith services. We provide professional, itemized digital receipts that you can submit for reimbursement.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Why do standard indoor deadbolts fail on outdoor gates?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Indoor locks are designed for climate-controlled environments. When exposed to NJ&#39;s humidity and road salt, internal zinc components oxidize and &#39;seize.&#39; Furthermore, gates have much larger &#39;gaps&#39; than doors. We install specialized &#39;Gate Boxes&#39; or &#39;Adjustable-Throw&#39; locks that can bridge a 1-2 inch gap and feature weep-holes for moisture drainage.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;What are the NJ requirements for pool gate locks?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;According to the NJ International Residential Code (IRC), pool gates must be self-closing and self-latching. The latch must be located at least 54 inches from the bottom of the gate to prevent small children from reaching it. We carry specialized &#39;MagnaLatch&#39; and &#39;TruClose&#39; hardware that is specifically certified for these safety standards.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Can I use a smart lock on my backyard fence?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes, but it must be an &#39;IP-Rated&#39; weatherproof model. We recommend the Lockey E-910 or specialized outdoor smart boxes from Yale. These feature rubberized gasketing to prevent water from reaching the electronics and are designed to function in temperatures as low as -30°F.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;My gate has shifted and the lock no longer matches the hole. Can you fix it?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;This is a common issue caused by NJ&#39;s freeze-thaw cycle shifting fence posts. We install &#39;Adjustable Striker&#39; plates that allow for 1-2 inches of vertical and horizontal play. This means your gate can shift slightly as the seasons change without you ever being locked out.&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;question&quot;:[0,&quot;Do you install &#39;Crash Bars&#39; on commercial security gates?&quot;],&quot;answer&quot;:[0,&quot;Yes. For apartment complexes or commercial back-access gates, we install outdoor-rated exit devices (panic bars) that allow for emergency egress while maintaining high-security perimeter control.&quot;]}]]],&quot;itemsPerPage&quot;:[0,8],&quot;background&quot;:[0,&quot;default&quot;]}" renderer-url=/_astro/client.DCKK-Ipe.js ssr uid=Z1zvgsw await-children><section class="lg:py-20 py-16 bg-background" id=category-6><div class=container-custom><div class="mx-auto max-w-3xl"><div class="items-center flex gap-4 mb-10"><div class="items-center flex justify-center bg-primary/10 text-primary h-12 rounded-xl w-12"><svg class="lucide h-6 w-6 lucide-wrench" height=24 width=24 viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true fill=none stroke=currentColor stroke-linecap=round stroke-linejoin=round stroke-width=2 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M14.7 6.3a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.4l1.6 1.6a1 1 0 0 0 1.4 0l3.106-3.105c.32-.322.863-.22.983.218a6 6 0 0 1-8.259 7.057l-7.91 7.91a1 1 0 0 1-2.999-3l7.91-7.91a6 6 0 0 1 7.057-8.259c.438.12.54.662.219.984z"></path></svg></div><h2 class="text-foreground font-bold font-display text-2xl">Service-Specific Questions</h2></div><div class="border-border border rounded-2xl divide-border divide-y"><div><button class="items-center flex justify-between text-left w-full duration-300 focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-inset focus-visible:ring-primary hover:bg-muted/50 px-6 py-5 transition-all bg-primary/5 shadow-[inset_4px_0_0_0_theme(colors.primary.500)]" aria-expanded=true aria-controls=accordion-content-cat-6-faq-0 type=button><span class="duration-300 font-bold font-display text-lg tracking-tight transition-colors text-primary">How do you verify authorization for a commercial lockout in NJ?</span><span class="items-center flex transition-colors justify-center h-8 rounded-full w-8 bg-primary shadow-glow text-primary-foreground"><svg class="h-5 w-5 lucide lucide-chevron-down" height=24 width=24 viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true fill=none stroke=currentColor stroke-linecap=round stroke-linejoin=round stroke-width=2 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></span></button><div class=overflow-hidden id=accordion-content-cat-6-faq-0 style=height:auto;opacity:1><div class="pt-2 text-muted-foreground pb-4 px-6">Commercial security requires strict protocol.
